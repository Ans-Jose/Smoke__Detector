# ðŸ”¥ Smoke Detector Project  

  This is a simple **Smoke Detector** built using sensors and microcontroller technology.  
  The project is designed to detect the presence of smoke in the environment and provide an alert for safety.  

##  Features
  - Detects smoke using a smoke/gas sensor ( MQ-2).  
  - Gives an **alarm alert** when smoke is detected.  
  - Low-cost and easy to build.  
  - Can be used at homes, labs, or workplaces for safety.  

##  Components Used
  - Arduino / Microcontroller
  - MQ-2 Smoke Sensor  
  - Buzzer / Alarm  
  - Resistors, Wires, Breadboard  
  - Power Supply  

##  How It Works
  1. The smoke sensor continuously monitors the air.  
  2. If smoke concentration goes above a set limit, the sensor triggers the Arduino.  
  3. The Arduino activates the **buzzer/alarm** to alert people.  

##  Applications
  - Fire safety system for homes.  
  - Industrial and lab safety.  
  - Early warning system for smoke/fire accidents.
